                        At Genesys, we believe in the learning
                        processes as much as we believe in the results. 
                        By applying a combination of active and social learning methodologies, 
                        we create an environment that involves the learner in the 
                        learning process while providing avenues for collaboration and peer-to-peer mentorship.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Our methods over the years have helped
                        us discover ways to take education out of the classroom. 
                        We introduce our interns to learning by experimentation and problem-solving. 
                        To us, every task is an opportunity to learn.

                    <p>
                    We have designed other learning activities that aren’t classroom-based. 
                    You will learn how to be a better person, how to
                    have good conversations, how to work better with 
                    people and most importantly, how to lead other people. 
                    Hey! We’ll even teach you how to run a business during the Learnable Business Sessions.

                    <p>
                        Before you’re done with Learnable, you will apply 
                        everything you’ve learned. You’ll be part of a team 
                        made up of 2 designers and 4 developers. You’ll get 
                        to work alongside the Genesys team on projects and 
                        we’ll teach you how “the sauce” is made. By combining 
                        technology, design, and great ideas, your team will 
                        have the unique opportunity to collaborate with the 
                        Genesys team to bring your own concept to life, from 
                        the first pen sketches to the final functioning product. 
                        You’ll then get to show off your special project to everyone.
